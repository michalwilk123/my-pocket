## How to debug code

1. Add print statements to carefully determine and debug actual issue.
2. Set up smaller test or scripts to isolate the issue itself
3. ALWAYS test if the hypothesis of source of the issue is correct. Never assume anything at hindsight. Be very careful when coming into a conclusion.
4. Suggest fixes and causes and present them for review.
5. If the user accepts the fixes, implement them. Always ask for confirmation before implementing fixes.
6. If the issue is a obvious syntax typo, please dont ask for user approve and fix it immediately.
